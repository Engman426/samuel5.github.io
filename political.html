        <h2>Supreme Court Strikes Down Voting Rights Act Provision</h2>
        <p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. Supreme Court today struck down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of voter discrimination to get federal approval before making changes to their voting laws.</p>
        <p>The decision was met with criticism from civil rights groups and Democratic lawmakers, who argued that the provision was necessary to prevent voter suppression. Republican leaders hailed the decision as a victory for states' rights.</p>
        <p>The Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 to protect the voting rights of African Americans and other minority groups. The provision that was struck down by the Supreme Court had been used to block voting restrictions in several states, including Texas and North Carolina.</p>
